*   A cycle-time analysis is currently not possible. A RCS-Controller of this 
*   robot currently not exist.

*   This motionparameters.e file contains neither joint velocities and joint
*   accelerations nor Cartesian velocities and Cartesian accelerations. 
*
*   A simulation is always based on assumptions with simplifications.
*   This model of robot
*
*   - can not simulate the dynamic behaviours of a robot
*   (e.g. oscillation and vibrations)
*
*   - can not support the I/O functions of the robot. (restriction in RRS1)
*
*   - can not support external friction and inertia.
*   (e.g. gripper holding force, spot welding rebound etc.)
*
*   - can not simulate the sensitivity of the robot
*   - can not simulate the human-robot-collaboration
*   - can not check the safety of the robot
